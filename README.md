- 👋 Hi, I’m @korokseed / Lexi 👩‍💻 a multi-disciplinary designer. Wow, that's a mouthful 👀
- 👀 I’m interested in many things. UX & Service design, visual arts, behavioural psychology, music composition, gardening... I could go on 😜...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about SVG anims, autism, web a11y and permaculture
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on neuroaffirming 🌈♾ User Experience, government transformation and products/services that help regenerate the natural world.
